# AGENTS.md — Oh My Second Brain Contributor Rules

> This file contains **contributor / developer rules** for the Oh My Second Brain repository.
> It is NOT the vault-convention SSOT for end users — that lives in `core/AGENTS.md`

## What is Oh My Second Brain?

Oh My Second Brain is a host-agnostic, user-owned convention layer for Obsidian markdown vaults. It ships a
TypeScript runtime and a set of markdown conventions that keep vault notes consistently structured,
linked, and reusable. Oh My Second Brain is invoked from inside AI coding environments (Claude Code, Codex,
Hermes) and enforces — or warns about — frontmatter, naming, and linking rules that the user
defines in their own vault configuration (`vault/.oms/`).

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
npm run build   # tsc — compiles src/ to dist/ (NodeNext module resolution)
npm run lint    # tsc --noEmit — type-check only, no output
npm test        # vitest — runs the test suite
```

CI pipeline order: **build first, then test**. A broken build blocks the test run.

---

## CRITICAL: NodeNext Import Extensions

**tsconfig uses `moduleResolution: NodeNext`.**

Every relative import inside `src/**/*.ts` MUST include a `.js` extension:

```ts
// correct
import { loadOntology } from './ontology/loader.js';

// WRONG — build will fail
import { loadOntology } from './ontology/loader';
```

Vitest resolves imports differently and will NOT catch missing extensions.
Only `npm run build` (tsc) will surface this error. Always run `npm run lint`
after editing imports.

---

## Convention-as-Data

- The active convention is **user-owned**: resolved from `vault/.oms/` at runtime.
- Oh My Second Brain ships read-only **defaults** in `core/ontology/`.
- Enforcement policy: `onViolation: warn` — violations are non-blocking by default.
- Schema policy: `additionalProperties: preserve` — unknown fields are kept, not rejected.
- Never change these defaults to blocking/error without an explicit product decision.

---

## Contribution Rules

- **Keep diffs small.** One concern per PR. Prefer targeted edits over broad refactors.
- **No new dependencies without approval.** Current runtime dependency: `yaml` only.
  Adding any dependency requires explicit sign-off in the PR description.
- **No `any` without justification.** Add a comment explaining why if you must use it.
- **Test new logic paths.** Any new branch in `src/` should have a corresponding vitest case.
- **Backward-compatible config changes only.** If a config shape changes, provide a migration path.
- Run `npm run lint && npm run build && npm test` before opening a PR and confirm all pass.

## core/AGENTS.md vs. AGENTS.md

| File | Purpose | Owner |
|------|---------|-------|
| `/AGENTS.md` (this file) | Contributor rules for the Oh My Second Brain repo | Dev lane |
| `/core/AGENTS.md` | Vault-convention SSOT for end users | Separate lane |

Do not conflate them. Do not create or modify `core/AGENTS.md` from this lane.
